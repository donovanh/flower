# Flower in CSS

Just messing around with border radius and overlapping shapes. Feel free to use as you wish!

Demo: [http://hop.ie/flower](http://hop.ie/flower)

## Usage

You'll need to install [Grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com/installing-grunt) to use the build process. With Grunt in place, run:

	npm install

This will set up dependencies. Then, run:

	grunt watch

This will compile any changes to the SASS files within the `sass` folder and place the processed result in the `stylesheets` folder.
